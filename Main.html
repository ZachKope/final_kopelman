                    <p>NFL teams interview a multitude of diverse candidates for their open positions every year. This is due to something called the Rooney Rule, which mandates NFL teams interview a set number of minority candidates for every major job. While this rule has mixed reviews and there is currently a lawsuit pending against the NFL by former Dolphins coach Brian Flores in relation to it and his firing, the NFL makes strides to update and improve the effictiveness of the rule yearly. The same cannot be said about college football, which does not have any similar rule in place and is therefore seeing a large disparity in the number of minority student atletes with the number of minority coaches who are hired to work with these players.</p>
                    <h3>A Disparity Between Players and Coaches</h3>
                    <p> College football is seemingly a very diverse sport. Football players come from a variety of backgrounds and from all around the country and even the world. In 2021, around 47% of student-athletes who played collegiate football were black. Around 61% of players in the SEC, college football's best conference, were black. The same cannot be said for coaching staffs in the sport.</p>

                    <p>35 of the 65 "Power 5" schools have not hired a black head football coach in their history. Zero SEC teams have a current black head coach, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/31905530/the-history-black-hires-college-football-leadership"> an article from ESPN</a>. Under 16% of head coaches in college football this past season were black. At the same time, white coaches continue to dominate the sport, as at least 80% of all head coaches have been white since 2014. The same can be said for lower level coaching positions, where the majority of offensive and defensive coordinators are white.</p>

                    <h3>Complacency</h3>
                    <p>One major issue in the fight for more diversity in college football is thhe complacency, specifically by the athletes. It is not all their fault; players just went through a long fight over their name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights and with much of their advocacy going towards themselves it is understandable, to an extent, they would not go out of their way to advocate for others. But NIL is here now, and despite it's mixed reviews for the integrity of the sport the players no longer need to worry about fighting for it. A major fault is that players who are currently being coached by minority head coaches do not need to worry about other team because they are only in college for typically four years. At Syracuse, where Dino Babers has been head coach since 2016, his players don't see their diverse coaching staff, made up of Babers and two non-white coordinators, as a defining or important characteristic of their locker room. Wide receiver Damien Alford said that the mentality in the locker room is more about family than any overarching issue with the sport</p>
                    <p>"Honestly we don't even think about that," Alford said. "(Coach Babers says) regardless of your culture, background, whatever, we're all just one family. We're there for one common goal. We don't really think about it."</p>
                    <p>While in a locker room context, it is important to put the team first, it is easy to tell that the team doesn't realize the significance within the context of the NCAA of playing for such a diverse staff. It does not really exist in most other places. This is where it is up to Babers and other black coaches to advocate for non-white candidates to get the top jobs they are not getting, such as in the SEC.</p>
                    <p>These issues do not go unnoticed by coaches, either. Michigan State head coach and BIG10 coach of the year Mel Tucker said <a href="https://andscape.com/features/even-with-the-recent-push-for-diversity-fewer-black-coaches-getting-top-fbs-head-coaching-jobs/">in a 2021 article</a> that he waited to see if black candidates would fill any of the top spots in 2020</p>
                    <p>“Once I saw jobs start to open up, I wanted to see if there was going to be anything different, whether there would be more minorities, coaches of color, hired as head coaches,” said Tucker. “I didn’t see a noticeable difference. I didn’t see anything that showed me that there was any type of change in behavior in the hiring process.”</p>
                    <p>In that 2020 coaching cycle, no new black coaches were hired in the power 5 conferences and more black head coaches lost their jobs then in years prior. While these issues are noted by black head men like Tucker, there is very little being done in terms of change at the top</p>

                    <h3>No Excuses</h3>
                    <p>Very little has been done at the highest level of college football, through the NCAA or conference commissioners, to incentivize diverse hires like they are in the NFL. The excuse for that is that college sports are a much more broad field than NFL teams, they cannot just focus on football. Athletic directors need to deal with acedemics, recruiting, and 20+ other teams that need coaching staffs.</p> 
                    <p>Current Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby hired one of the longest tenured African American head coaches, Stanford's David Shaw, while Bowlsby was the athletic director there. He said in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30435797/the-lack-black-college-football-coaches-glaring-the-excuses-it">2020 article</a> that the Big 12 should be held accountable for lacking a single black head coach among their conference's ranks. Despite this, the 2021 season saw yet another year where the Big 12 did not have a black lead man. Bowlsby's former hire, Shaw, said in the same article there is not enough incentive or pressure from higher-ups to force teams in conferences like the Big 12's hands.</p>
                    <p>"Whoever is pulling the trigger on hiring, it's still going to be who they want it to be," Shaw said. "I don't think there is an answer."</p>

                    <h3>Failure and Where to Look</h3>
                    <p>Many position coaches in college football feel they are being hired solely because of their race. 49 of the 65 Power 5 schools employeed black men as their runningbacks coach in 2020. THe reasoning for this, according to some, is that black coaches "get along better" with black players, who in the same season made up over 48% of all college football players. Some coaches are beginning to take issue with this, like Navy's Ivin Jasper who was also cited in this <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30435797/the-lack-black-college-football-coaches-glaring-the-excuses-it">ESPN article</a> for believing that hiring black people for lower level assitant jobs and reserving higher opprotunity for white candidates has become normalized in this country.</p> 
                    <p>"I don't want to be hired because I'm Black," Jasper said. "I just don't want to not be hired because I'm Black."</p>
                    <p>If the NCAA wants answers, they shouldn't have to look far for inspiration. The NFL has the Rooney Rule, which provides incentives for teams who develop minority candidates on top of requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate for every position. Oregon passed a law, detailed in <a href="https://globalsportmatters.com/business/2020/09/24/oregons-rooney-rule-shifts-the-game/">this article</a> which requires a similar thing of college teams when hiring coaches. The idea of making this rule universal has precident that was set in Oregon, and the NCAA could add additional incentive, such as increased TV revenue, to teams that hire or develop non-white candidates into major roles.</p>
